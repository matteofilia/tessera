Initial placeholder code looks good for just getting started. Still haven't decided if Tessera will be a compiled language or an interpreted language. Maybe both! Feeling hopeful for the future. Not so hard, right? That being said, creating a custom programming language is no easy task.

Changed the file extension from .tess to .ts, that way I can see the TypeScript percentage in the overview. Might change this back later.

Have been reading a lot of code from other toy programming languages. First thing to get started with will probably be the lexer.

Got Ant setup, so that is good. Otherwise, haven't made much progress.

Want to work on the website a little bit. I just worry that doing so would be "putting the cart before the horse".

Okay, got some work done on the website. It looks absolutely awful. That being said, it is workable for now. I know what I want: a simple input/output interface to run code. I'll make it look a little better sometime in the future. Honestly, I kind of like how the website looks. It's so aggresively minimal and terrible. Love it!

Got the previous / next buttons to work and cycle through the example files. This is good progress! Next up: work on the lexer, probably.

Took a long time to setup my dev environment for my MacBook today. Honestly, kind of dissapointed. Really enjoy using WSL for development.

Spent some time working on the lexer today, several hours or so. So far, progress has been very slow. Already feel like giving up but need to keep going. Still, I have budgeted more than enough time to get things done. Maybe ten to twenty hours per chapter, for a total of 220 hours. Don't need for everything to be amazing, just need to have the language be able to do the basics.

Fixed a problem with cheerpj not working. The fix was simple: compile using older version of Java. Proud of myself for figuring that one out! Otherwise, things are going well enough.

So far, we have been making good progress. Hours wise, right now we are ahead of things. Goal is to have this finished by May 10 (my birthday).

Yes, honestly not certain that I will be able to get Java to work with JavaScript. Starting to get mildly concerned that I will need to switch languages... I really hope not! Either way, this problem is tomorrow's problem. I can always think about things later. For now, there are other pressing concerns.

Done some more thinking. Starting to think my ideal of a static website isn't going to work. It's simply too janky, integrating Java and JavaScript. What does this mean? It means that we will have to implement a REST server, most likely. More work!

Spring is more complicated than I remember... just want a simple Java webserver to be able to compile code. Man, things are really harder than they look! Should probably learn a little bit more. I think that I still have a book for Spring, should probably read that.

Got some of the web code working. Progress is slow but steady. Slow and steady wins the race, yes?

Sloppy, very very sloppy. This code is a mess. Oh well, it works. Good thing that there are no code reviews!

Honestly, my brain feels kind of fried. I think that I have done enough for today. That being said, still haven't completed enough hours. Probably won't have a chance to work on anything tomorrow, unfortunately.

Have been fiddling with the website. Would really like for there to be lexer and parser output. That being said, after much fiddling,  I have decided that KISS is the right approach: Keep It Simple, Stupid. All this work on the parser and lexer to go completely unseen... unfortunate. That being said, something simple and straightfoward is best. Simplicity is elegence.

You know what? I have made a decision: Tessera will be an interpreted language. I want to see results quickly. I also don't feel like messing around with assembly code. Let's start small. Maybe sometime in the future we can make a full compiler.

Spent a solid two hours or so just refactoring code in an attempt to make the code base less terrible. Man, this is really harder than it looks. I thought I was decent at naming things and structuring code, too. Simple and elegant is what we would like. That being said, I highly doubt that anyone will go poking around inside things. If it works then that should be good enough!
