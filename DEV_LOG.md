Initial placeholder code looks good for just getting started. Still haven't decided if Tessera will be a compiled language or an interpreted language. Maybe both! Feeling hopeful for the future. Not so hard, right? That being said, creating a custom programming language is no easy task.

Changed the file extension from .tess to .ts, that way I can see the TypeScript percentage in the overview. Might change this back later.

Have been reading a lot of code from other toy programming languages. First thing to get started with will probably be the lexer.

Got Ant setup, so that is good. Otherwise, haven't made much progress.

Want to work on the website a little bit. I just worry that doing so would be "putting the cart before the horse".

Okay, got some work done on the website. It looks absolutely awful. That being said, it is workable for now. I know what I want: a simple input/output interface to run code. I'll make it look a little better sometime in the future. Honestly, I kind of like how the website looks. It's so aggresively minimal and terrible. Love it!

Got the previous / next buttons to work and cycle through the example files. This is good progress! Next up: work on the lexer, probably.
