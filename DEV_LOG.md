Initial placeholder code looks good for just getting started. Still haven't decided if Tessera will be a compiled language or an interpreted language. Maybe both! Feeling hopeful for the future. Not so hard, right? That being said, creating a custom programming language is no easy task.

Changed the file extension from .tess to .ts, that way I can see the TypeScript percentage in the overview. Might change this back later.

Have been reading a lot of code from other toy programming languages. First thing to get started with will probably be the lexer.

## Feb 9, 2025

Got Ant setup, so that is good. Otherwise, haven't made much progress.

Want to work on the website a little bit. I just worry that doing so would be "putting the cart before the horse".

Okay, got some work done on the website. It looks absolutely awful. That being said, it is workable for now. I know what I want: a simple input/output interface to run code. I'll make it look a little better sometime in the future. Honestly, I kind of like how the website looks. It's so aggresively minimal and terrible. Love it!

Got the previous / next buttons to work and cycle through the example files. This is good progress! Next up: work on the lexer, probably.

## Feb 10, 2025

Took a long time to setup my dev environment for my MacBook today. Honestly, kind of dissapointed. Really enjoy using WSL for development.

Spent some time working on the lexer today, several hours or so. So far, progress has been very slow. Already feel like giving up but need to keep going. Still, I have budgeted more than enough time to get things done. Maybe ten to twenty hours per chapter, for a total of 220 hours. Don't need for everything to be amazing, just need to have the language be able to do the basics.

Fixed a problem with cheerpj not working. The fix was simple: compile using older version of Java. Proud of myself for figuring that one out! Otherwise, things are going well enough.

So far, we have been making good progress. Hours wise, right now we are ahead of things. Goal is to have this finished by May 10 (my birthday).

Yes, honestly not certain that I will be able to get Java to work with JavaScript. Starting to get mildly concerned that I will need to switch languages... I really hope not! Either way, this problem is tomorrow's problem. I can always think about things later. For now, there are other pressing concerns.

Done some more thinking. Starting to think my ideal of a static website isn't going to work. It's simply too janky, integrating Java and JavaScript. What does this mean? It means that we will have to implement a REST server, most likely. More work!

## Feb 12, 2025

Spring is more complicated than I remember... just want a simple Java webserver to be able to compile code. Man, things are really harder than they look! Should probably learn a little bit more. I think that I still have a book for Spring, should probably read that.

Got some of the web code working. Progress is slow but steady. Slow and steady wins the race, yes?

Sloppy, very very sloppy. This code is a mess. Oh well, it works. Good thing that there are no code reviews!

Honestly, my brain feels kind of fried. I think that I have done enough for today. That being said, still haven't completed enough hours. Probably won't have a chance to work on anything tomorrow, unfortunately.

## Feb 13, 2025

Have been fiddling with the website. Would really like for there to be lexer and parser output. That being said, after much fiddling,  I have decided that KISS is the right approach: Keep It Simple, Stupid. All this work on the parser and lexer to go completely unseen... unfortunate. That being said, something simple and straightfoward is best. Simplicity is elegence.

You know what? I have made a decision: Tessera will be an interpreted language. I want to see results quickly. I also don't feel like messing around with assembly code. Let's start small. Maybe sometime in the future we can make a full compiler.

## Feb 14, 2025

Spent a solid two hours or so just refactoring code in an attempt to make the code base less terrible. Man, this is really harder than it looks. I thought I was decent at naming things and structuring code, too. Simple and elegant is what we would like. That being said, I highly doubt that anyone will go poking around inside things. If it works then that should be good enough!

## Feb 15, 2025

It turns out that balancing an AST tree is harder than it seems. Also, the code is completely broken. It turns out that building a programming language is harder than it looks! Anyway, not sure what the path moving forwards looks like.

I should get a new book in a couple days or so. Hopefully I will be able to learn more about building an interpreter.

Yes, progress is slow. That being said, we are in fact making progress.

## Feb 16, 2025

It's MY programming language. I can define how an AST is constructed, yes? I just worry that I may be doing something the "wrong" way, something that will cause problems later on.

My brain feels somewhat fried today. Feeling very tired. Might leave certain things until tomorrow. Time to work on something simpler, maybe. Just a little bit of busywork.

Right now, we are at a standstill. I feel like giving up on this project. Have to stay strong and keep moving forwards. Maybe it is time to find something easier to work on for the time being. That being said, I am not sure what that would be. The parser needs to be completed to continue making forward progress, as far as I can see.

Ok, did some more work. And guess what? I actually got it working! Tessera now can process simple math operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This is a BIG win and a great step forwards.

## Feb 17, 2025

Again feeling very tired today. Next step is to get global variables to work. This should be fun! Yeah, this is probably going to take at least another day or two of work, most likely.

## Feb 26, 2025

Have been feeling very tired this past week. Got some work done on the website, so that is good. Not sure why I am so tired as of recently. Burnout? Maybe. Either that or something else. Hopefully things get better in a couple days or so and we go back to making progress. All we can do right now is wait and hope that things get better. I am still committed to this project, not giving up yet!

## Apr 25, 2025

Alright, jumping back into things. Added some CSS styling to make the web page mobile-aware. Would like to continue doing more work but have been so mentally tired as of lately. Going to try a new approach (CBT for mental fatigue) and we will see if things go better. I am tentatively hopeful. I CAN finish this project, if I put my mind to it (hopefully).

## May 05, 2025

Still not making much progress. Lacking motivation, lacking energy. But motivation seems to be the bigger issue. Moving forwards, I need a new strategy.

## August 26, 2025

Everything is broken... Nothing works. Still, at least I am feeling a little better in terms of energy. A fluke, maybe? Only time will tell. Still hoping to actually complete this project. Have started getting things setup on AWS.

## August 29, 2025

Don't need for things to be perfect, just need for things to do things. Going to do my best to continue making slow and steady progress, if that is even possible. Fixed an error with the parser today. Small steps like that are exactly the kind of slow progress that I should continue making.
