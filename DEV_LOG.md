Initial placeholder code looks good for just getting started. Still haven't decided if Tessera will be a compiled language or an interpreted language. Maybe both! Feeling hopeful for the future. Not so hard, right? That being said, creating a custom programming language is no easy task.

Changed the file extension from .tess to .ts, that way I can see the Typescript percentage in the overview. Might change this back later.

Have been reading a lot of code from other toy programming languages. First thing to get started with will probably be the lexer.
